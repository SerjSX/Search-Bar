# Search-Bar
This is my own search bar created from scratch with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Visit here to view it: Visit here to view the search bar: https://serjsx.github.io/Search-Bar/

# Features:
- Modern UI with light theme (dark theme soon)
- Keyboard shortcuts: Enter for search, ESC for cancelling
- TABBED: search bar buttons are tabbable, and the keyboard shortcuts work with them as well
- When clicking on the search logo with nothing typed, it focuses on the search bar and changes the text that's in the search bar, making it obvious that something needs to be typed in order to search.
